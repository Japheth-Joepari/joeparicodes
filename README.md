# Clone and Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `react-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Japheth-Joepari/japheth-joepari-portfolio

  ```

  This will clone the whole repository in your system.

- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  ```node
  npm install
  ```
- Now the project is ready to use
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

# Customize it to make your own portfolio ✏️

In this project, there are basically 4 things that you need to change to customize this to anyone else's portfolio: **package.json**, **Personal Information**, **Github Information** and **Splash Logo**.

### package.json

Open this file, which is in the main cloned directory, choose any "name" and change "homepage " to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io`. Do not forget the `https://`, otherwise fonts will not load.

### Personal Information

You will find `src/portfolio.js` file which contains the complete information about the user. The file looks something like below:

```javascript
// Home Page
const greeting = {
    ...
}

// Social Media
const socialMediaLinks = {
    ...
}

...
```

You can change the personal information, experience, education, social media, certifications, blog information, contact information etc. in `src/portfolio.js` to directly reflect them in portfolio website.

### How to change the icons on homepage under what i do section?

1. This section pulls data from `skills` in portfolio.js file.
2. Visit this website: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/
3. Search for the skill you are looking to add.
4. Select the icon of your choice.
5. Copy the text beside **Selected Icon** and replace it with `fontAwesomeClassName` of that particular softwareSkill.

### Github Information

You will find `git_data_fetcher.mjs` file in the main directory of the repository. This file is used to fetch the data (Pull requests, Issues, Organizations, Pinned projects etc.) from your github.
If you open the file, you will see below component at the top of the file. You need to change only that component.

```javascript
const openSource = {
  githubConvertedToken: "Your Github Token Here.",
  githubUserName: "Your Github Username Here.",
};
```

You can get a github token as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). Give all permissions while generating token. Also add your `githubUserName` in the correct field inside `git_data_fetcher.mjs`.
Now, you need to run following command.

**Warning:** Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your programs.

```node
node git_data_fetcher.mjs
```

This will fetch all the data from your github and it will automatically replace my data with yours.
Whenever you want to update the github related information on the website you need to run this command.

## Other

- You need to change the website title and other descriptions in `public/index.html`
- You can define your own favicon in `public/icons` directory. If you don't have a favicon, you can generate favicons from [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and [Favicon IO](https://favicon.io/)
- You can also edit your website preview (known as description image). Run your site locally, take a screenshot and replace with `public/icons/desc.png`. Note that your screenshot should be 1280x640 for better preview.

# Choose Theme 🌈

- You can take a look at `src/theme.js` file where all available themes are mentioned with their respective color codes
- At the bottom of this file you will see the below code:
  - `export const chosenTheme = blueTheme;`
  - You need to change the name from `blueTheme` to whatever theme you want to set your website to
  - You can define new theme similarly as other themes and you can assign name of that new defined theme to `chosenTheme`
- That's it. You just need to change the theme name and the code will take care of everything else
- Run `npm start` to check if everything is ok.

# Deployment 📦

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, you need to generate a production build and deploy the website.

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository on github. That's it. It's Done.
- You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.
